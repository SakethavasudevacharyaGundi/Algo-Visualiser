# Algorithm Visualizer
- Algorithm Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and visualize popular algorithms.
- This project includes visualizations for various sorting algorithms such as:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - And more
- Additionally, it covers standard algorithms related to data structures, including:
    - Dijkstra's Pathfinding
    - Depth-First Search
    - Breadth-First Search
- By providing a visual representation of these algorithms, the application aims to make learning and understanding complex algorithms easier and more intuitive.
